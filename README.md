# calory-counter
simple hackathon app from Oct-Nov 2022 which is used to follow proper nutrition
This app uses kotlin as the main programming language and xml as mail layout language.
This app uses pre-installed local product database and uses room and shared preferences to save local data.
Libraries also used: circleprogress, MPAndroidChart
This app will be improved and I'm going to fix all of the bugs left.
